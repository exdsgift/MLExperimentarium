## How this script works

`import cv2`: This statement imports the OpenCV library, which is a popular computer vision library used for image and video processing.

`import mediapipe as mp`: This statement imports the MediaPipe library, which is a library developed by Google for multimedia processing pipeline.


`mp_drawing` = mp.solutions.drawing_utils: This statement imports the drawing_utils sub-library of MediaPipe and assigns it to the variable mp_drawing, which will be used later to draw the detection results.

`mp_drawing_styles` = mp.solutions.drawing_styles: This statement imports the drawing styles of MediaPipe.

`mphands` = mp.solutions.hands: This statement imports the module of MediaPipe for hand detection and assigns it to the variable mphands.

`cap` = cv2.VideoCapture(0): This statement opens the video stream from the built-in camera or the first connected camera to the computer and assigns it to the variable cap.

`while` True:: This creates an infinite loop, ensuring that the following code runs continuously until manually interrupted.

`data, image = cap.read()`: This line captures a frame (image) from the video capture (cap) and stores it in the variable image. The return value data indicates whether the frame was successfully read.

`image` = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.flip(image,1), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB): This line flips the image horizontally (since OpenCV captures the image in BGR format by default) and converts it to RGB format, which is required for processing by the MediaPipe library.

`results` = hands.process(image): This line processes the flipped and converted image using the hands object created earlier, which detects hand landmarks in the image.

`image` = cv2.cvtColor(image,cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR): This line converts the image back to BGR format for displaying it using OpenCV.



`if results.multi_hand_landmarks:`: This condition checks if there are detected hand landmarks in the processed image.

`for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:`: If hand landmarks are detected, this loop iterates over each set of hand landmarks found in the image.

`mp_drawing.draw_landmarks(...)`: This function draws the landmarks and connections on the image using the mp_drawing object. The landmarks and connections are based on the detected hand landmarks (hand_landmarks) and defined connections (mphands.HAND_CONNECTIONS).

`cv2.imshow('Handtracker', image)`: This line displays the processed image with the hand landmarks drawn on it in a window named 'Handtracker'.

`if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):`: This condition checks if the key pressed is 'q' (quit). If 'q' is pressed, the loop breaks, and the program exits.


`cap.release()`: This releases the video capture object, allowing other applications to access the camera.

`cv2.destroyAllWindows()`: This closes all OpenCV windows.
